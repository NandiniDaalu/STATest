The things i would suggest on the login page will be 

1. I as an user took couple of minutes to Join as a new user. It will be ideal if Join Now is below the LoginIn button 

2. The first name and last name fields can take the string with space. for ex: First Name: Nand Ini (it still works),
   Last Name: Ram mesh(it still works)
   
 3. Email address field validation is not very appropriate. It can take invalid email addresses to join as 
  a new/ existing user
